       Implementation notes:
         * This showcases how compiler can move the publishing store past the field stores.
         * We need to provide constructor with some external value. If we put the constants in the
           constructor, then compiler can store all the fields with a single bulk store.
         * This test is best to be run with either 32-bit VM, or 64-bit VM with -XX:-UseCompressedOops:
           it seems the compressed references mechanics moves the reference store after the field
           stores, even though not required by JMM.
